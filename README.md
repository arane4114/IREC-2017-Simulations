# IREC-2017-Simulations
All the relevant files for the UA IREC 2017 team

This repo contains the Matlab script used to generate the motor used by the 2017 University of Arizona IREC team. This scrip generates a series of graphs displaying key motor parameters and can also generate Rocksim Engine Files that can be imported by other programs. The program can accept cylindrical grains of different lengths. The propellant data is hardcoded but can be changed as needed. 


There will be no further development of this particular codebase. Further development of this project will be at https://github.com/Dantran93/OpenBurn
